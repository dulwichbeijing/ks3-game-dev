Welcome to Year 9 Game Development! I assume you selected this option because you are interested in learning how to create your own video games.

Well you’re in luck! I’m excited to introduce you to our game development rotation! First things first, we’ll be using Godot 4, a powerful game engine that will allow you to bring your ideas to life. And you won’t be doing it alone, teamwork makes the dream work and it’s crucial that you’re able to work well with your classmates throughout this course to build bigger and better games. Each of you will have the chance to touch all of the main areas of game design as you learn how to create 2D games from start to finish in Godot Engine 4 and GDScript.

By the end of the course, we’ll be holding the DCB game expo where you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your creations to the wider school community.
